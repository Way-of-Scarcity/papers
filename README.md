# The Scarcity Hypothesis Framework: A Collection of Philosophical and Mathematical Works

This repository contains a collection of documents exploring the **Scarcity Hypothesis** and related frameworks I developed from 2009 to 2025. These works represent a unified theory connecting mathematics, philosophy, ethics, economics, and cosmology through the fundamental concept of absence and scarcity.

## Core Concept

The central thesis across all documents is that **scarcity** (or "lack") is the fundamental driver of all processes in the universe. As stated in the foundational work: *"The lack of something causes its pursuit; more strongly, the lack of something necessitates its existence."* This principle applies from quantum mechanics to human desires, from mathematical structures to cosmic evolution.

## Document Overview

### Primary Works

#### [2009 - The Scarcity Hypothesis [S.H.]](./2009%20-%20The%20Scarcity%20Hypothesis%20%5BS.H.%5D%20-%20Dustin%20Darcy.pdf)
**The Foundation Document** - This is the original formulation of the Scarcity Hypothesis that unifies multiple disciplines through the concept of scarcity.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Mathematical Framework**: Uses trigonometric functions where life as exigency = cosine, life as good = sine, and life as value = tangent
- **Four Seasons of Scarcity**: Q1 (Aesthetic/Summer), Q2 (Simplicity/Fall), Q3 (Competition/Winter), Q4 (Plenty/Spring)
- **Civilization Progression**: Maps human development from Early-Homo through Kardashev Type 1-4 civilizations
- **Cosmic Timeline**: Places current humanity at ~270Â° approaching the transition from Type 0 to Type 1 civilization
- **Economic Theory**: Argues no economic system is inherently "best"; rather each has its time and place based on scarcity conditions
- **Theological Implications**: Suggests omni-theism where both atheism and theism can be correct without paradox

**Visual Elements:** Contains diagrams showing the cyclical nature of scarcity and civilization development.

- **2009**: Initial formulation and discussion
- **2010-2011**: Refinement and clarification of key concepts
